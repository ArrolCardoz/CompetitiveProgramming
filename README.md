# Competitive Programming 🏆

This repository contains my solutions, notes, and progress in **competitive programming**.  
It serves as a personal archive of problem-solving practice and a way to track my journey.
**Disclaimer**
Not all of these solutions are correct, or even finished. There might also be some code that isn't entirely mine either because of the collaborative nature of the hobby.

## 📌 Main Focus (High Priority)

- 🐱 [**Kattis**](./Kattis) – My primary platform for problem-solving.
- 🏫 [**Weekly Club Contests**](./Kattis/Weekly%20Club/) – Problems from my university’s competitive programming club.

---

## 📂 Other Platforms (Secondary)

- 💡 **LeetCode** – Focused on arrays, strings, and interview-style problems.
- ⚔️ **Codewars** – Fun challenges to stay sharp.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Build consistency by solving **Kattis problems daily**.
- Improve contest performance through **weekly club practice**.
- Use LeetCode to strengthen **DSA fundamentals**.
- Explore harder problems on Codeforces/AtCoder for growth.
